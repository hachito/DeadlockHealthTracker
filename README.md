# Deadlock Health Tracker


I've been playing deadlock and I wanted to do something that made sure that I played better, which came in the form of looking at the health bar and playing sound effects via discord to force me to get more health. Because pytesseract couldn't read the deadlock
health font, I had to make a threshold for color and have the program count the pixels and if it's under the threshold, the sound effect would play.
